# PHP SQL Injection Vulnerability

This repository demonstrates a common SQL injection vulnerability in PHP applications and its solution.  The `bug.php` file shows vulnerable code that directly uses user input in an SQL query without sanitization.  The `bugSolution.php` file provides a secure alternative using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.  Always sanitize and validate user input before using it in database queries to protect your application from vulnerabilities.
