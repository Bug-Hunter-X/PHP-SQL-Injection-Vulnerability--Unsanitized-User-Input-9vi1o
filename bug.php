This code suffers from a common error in PHP: improper handling of user input.  Specifically, the `$_GET['id']` variable is used directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities. 

```php
<?php
$id = $_GET['id'];
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $id";
// ... query execution ...
?>
```
